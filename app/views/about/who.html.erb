<h1>Who We Are</h1>
<h2>Local Civic Innovators and Creative Problem-Solvers.</h2>
<p>
We are civic-minded residents committed to working with the City of Portland,
Multnomah County and other municipalities in the greater Portland area –
as well as other nonprofit organizations –
to make our region stronger.
We’re here to help and eager to learn from professional public servants.
And while we’re advocates for open government (we can’t build apps without open data!),
we’re non-partisan and public-minded.
</p>
<p>
We're a group of civic-minded coders, public-employees, designers,
and extraordinary citizens.
We work in partnership with government, non-profit,
and technical partners to deploy technology to improve quality of life
for all residents and increase citizen engagement with civic issues.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, our goal is to make life better for residents by improving personal and
collective outcomes through helping build local government services that are better,
faster, and cheaper and have the greatest impact for the greatest amount of people who
have the greatest need for assistance and efficient public services.

  Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
