    <h1>Who We Are</h1>
    <h2>Local Civic Innovators and Creative Problem-Solvers.</h2>
    <p>
    We are civic-minded residents committed to working with the City of Portland,
    Multnomah County and other municipalities in the greater Portland area –
    as well as other nonprofit organizations –
    to make our region stronger.
    We’re here to help and eager to learn from professional public servants.
    And while we’re advocates for open government (we can’t build apps without open data!),
    we’re non-partisan and public-minded.
    </p>
    <p>
    We're a group of civic-minded coders, public-employees, designers,
    and extraordinary citizens.
    We work in partnership with government, non-profit,
    and technical partners to deploy technology to improve quality of life
    for all residents and increase citizen engagement with civic issues.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ultimately, our goal is to make life better for residents by improving personal and
    collective outcomes through helping build local government services that are better,
    faster, and cheaper and have the greatest impact for the greatest amount of people who
    have the greatest need for assistance and efficient public services.
