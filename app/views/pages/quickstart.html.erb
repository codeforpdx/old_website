    <h3><em>Building a better community is up to all of us</em></h3>
    
    <p>
      We're not just about building software! No matter what your skill set,
      we'd love to have you on board. Improving the community requires all types.

        <p>
        <strong>Subject-Matter Experts</strong><br>
        People building technological solutions are usually not experts in the 
        field. If your technical expertise is a match for one of our projects, 
        excellent! If not, we want to hear from you. Our developers can still use 
        your guidance.
        </p>

        <strong>Project Managers</strong><br>
        All important projects need someone to plan, set the course, and clear 
        the roadblocks. If you have experience in tackling the big picture and 
        predicting problems before they arise, we'd love to hear from you.

        <strong>Designers</strong><br>
        Good design guides every-day decisions, from the most impactful to the 
        most mundane. If you know how to package information for maximum impact, 
        we need you at Code for PDX.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Advocates and Evangelists</strong><br>
        For our efforts to have a real impact, our projects need visibility - 
        both to those who will benefit, and to those who can recommend our work. 
        People with the gift for spreading the word are invaluable to what we do.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
        <strong>Coders</strong><br>
        Most of our projects will involve creating technical solutions to improve 
        people's lives. Come make an impact, while learning new skills along the 
        way.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
        <strong>Governments and Non-Profits</strong><br>
        Those with a strong overview of what our community needs are best placed 
        to help stewart our projects as they evolve. If you work with a local 
        government or organization focused on the common good, we want to hear 
        from you.
        </p>
